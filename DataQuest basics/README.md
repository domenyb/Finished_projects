## DataQuest basics

As a part of some kind of ad campaign I have recieved 1 week of free access to the popular Data Science... should I call it 'bootcamp' site, DataQuest.io . Since currently I don't have many projects, I have decided to use this opportunity and finish a guided project every day - and learn as much as I can -, since it never hurts to learn a bit more.
